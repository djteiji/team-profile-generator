# team-profile-generator
Weekly Challenge #10

## Purpose

Create a command line application that generates a roster of team members including a manager, engineers, and interns. 

- When the application is run using the node index.js command in the terminal, the user is prompted to enter their team manager's information.

- After the user enters manager info, they are then prompted to add team members to their roster. They can choose whether to add Engineers or Interns, and then answer a series of questions about them.

- After each team member is added, the user is asked whether they want to add any additional team members. If yes, they are returned to the team member information prompts.

- If the user declines to add additional team members, an HTML file is generated which when opened in the browser will display the full team roster with each member information on their own card, with team member info and links to their email and GitHUb profile, if applicable.
